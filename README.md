# WeatherApp
deployed [here, on netify](https://vvaasd-weather-app-2.netlify.app) (Github Pages do not support dynamic sites)

Dev mode: **Legacy**

Stack: **React**, **API**, JS, HTML, CSS. Builder: Create React App

- Work with data from API (data about city, forecast)
- Work with Local Storage
- hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext, useRef
- Created custom React hook useClickOutside
- Responsive Pixel Perfect layout (not in every task branch)
- Modular CSS

Within this project, trying to simulate real conditions, I completed technical tasks assigned to me and pushed them to remote repository (GitLab).
****After each task I was getting legacy code, so the quality of the code may vary from task to task.****

How to run dev mode (Node required):

- clone repository (main branch). Terminal commands (use it in cloned repository):
- npm i
- npm run start
